Start the level with a blue ocean, and a few enemies of a ww2 plane type.

These 6-8 enemies will be really easy to kill and have a low fire rate.

After killing them there will be a slight pause and then a shadow of the boss ship will go across the screen turning the water red.

Alien type enemies will start to spawn in after this.

Cylinder Earth. Enemies wrap around left to right and right to left.

Enemies that go off the bottom of the screen dont come back.

Introducing the Time Travel Mechanic.

After the introductory scene, the Time Travel UI will pop up on the screen. There will be a flashing text box, that says 'Jump Back - Press X'

The first time travel will be a maximum time length time travel. 

Not looking to pause the gameplay at all.
